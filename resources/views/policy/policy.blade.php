                                        At times, this website will contain links to the website of a third party we have retained to perform services on our behalf (for example, the filling out of online forms). You will know that you are on a third party’s website because it will have a different appearance and the address bar on your browser will change. Additionally, you may receive e-mails or text messages through a third party based on a request you make through this website for information, including notification of activities you have requested information about. At the time the third parties are selected, and periodically thereafter, their privacy and data protection policies are inspected to ensure that they meet the same standards we use for our own policies. However, these third parties provide apps and services whose programming, terms of use, privacy policies, and general conditions we cannot control. For this reason, your use of those apps and services on this website is subject to the current terms of service and general conditions set by the third party. We are not informed of updates, so please review the terms before using the third-party service. If you have questions about a third party’s policies, please see the policy listed on their website.
